# Swiftbot-Tunnel-Vision
It's a Swiftbot program which measures the three tunnel lengths provided using its camera input. The bot detects changes in light intensity to determine tunnel entry/exit, calculates distance travelled via calibrated speedâ€“time mapping, stops for obstacles within 40 cm, and logs execution details before termination.
